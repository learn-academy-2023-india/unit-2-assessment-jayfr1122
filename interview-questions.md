# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: providing an example can help communicate your point if you struggle with the vocabulary.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions: JF

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: A parameter is more broad than an argument.

Researched answer: Parameters are meant to represent data that will be input, meaning parameters can be applied and filled with multiple data types. Arguments are specific data points or the actual values that are calulated when a function is used.

2. What is the difference between an object and a class?

Your answer: Classes create objects.

Researched answer: Classes provide a template that is used when an object is created.

3. What is iteration?

Your answer: To analyze through each data point in succession.

Researched answer: Processing through a block of code multiple times with or without different variables being applied. 

4. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Researched answer: Hoisting is when variable and function declarations are to the top of the scope they are contained within allowing one to use those variables and functions before they are technically declared.
